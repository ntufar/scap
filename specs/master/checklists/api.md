# API Requirements Quality Checklist: Navigator Supply Chain Lakehouse

**Purpose**: Validate the clarity, completeness, and measurability of API-related requirements (unit tests for English). Author pre-commit aid.
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] CHK001 Are request parameter definitions complete for all endpoints (types, required/optional, formats)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009; Contracts §/unified-records]
- [X] CHK002 Are response payload schemas defined for success and error outcomes for each endpoint? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008; Contracts]
- [X] CHK003 Are pagination/windowing requirements specified where large result sets are possible? [Gap]
- [X] CHK004 Are filtering/sorting semantics documented for `unified-records` (fields, operators, limits)? [Gap; Contracts §/unified-records]
- [X] CHK005 Is versioning strategy for public API surfaces documented (e.g., path or header)? [Gap]

## Requirement Clarity

- [X] CHK006 Are time window parameters (`start`, `end`) semantics unambiguous (inclusive/exclusive, timezone, precision)? [Clarity; Contracts §/unified-records]
- [X] CHK007 Is determinism of joins in `unified-records` defined so results are reproducible for the same inputs? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]
- [X] CHK008 Are freshness status categories and thresholds clearly defined and mapped to domains? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011; Contracts §/freshness]
- [X] CHK009 Are DQ status fields (criticality levels, messages) specified with allowed values and structure? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007; Contracts §/dq/status]
- [X] CHK010 Are error models (error codes, structure, localization, retriable flag) clearly specified? [Clarity, Gap]

## Requirement Consistency

- [X] CHK011 Are authentication/authorization requirements consistent across all endpoints (none vs role-scoped)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-012]
- [X] CHK012 Are entity identifiers and naming consistent between spec and contracts (e.g., `productId`, `itemId`)? [Consistency; Spec §Key Entities; Contracts]
- [X] CHK013 Are timestamp and date formats consistent across endpoints (ISO-8601, date vs date-time)? [Consistency; Contracts]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality (Measurability)

- [X] CHK014 Can success criteria for `unified-records` be objectively verified (zero orphan keys, deterministic results)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Story 1]
- [X] CHK015 Can freshness endpoint outcomes be validated against SLA thresholds per domain? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004, §FR-011]
- [X] CHK016 Can DQ status endpoint outcomes be measured to confirm critical failures block publication? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002, §FR-007]

## Scenario Coverage

- [X] CHK017 Are alternate scenarios defined (e.g., empty result set, partial data availability)? [Coverage, Gap]
- [X] CHK018 Are exception scenarios defined (invalid parameters, unsupported combinations, unauthorized access)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-012]
- [X] CHK019 Are recovery/consistency scenarios defined (late-arriving updates reflected without duplicates)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [X] CHK020 Are boundary conditions for time windows specified (zero-length window, far-future/past limits)? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [X] CHK021 Are maximum result sizes and truncation behaviors specified? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [X] CHK022 Are rate limits or backpressure expectations documented for bursty clients? [Edge Case, Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [X] CHK023 Are performance targets for API queries stated or referenced (e.g., KPI queries ≤5s)? [NFR, Spec §Non-Functional Performance Target; §SC-003]
- [X] CHK024 Are availability/SLA expectations for endpoints defined (and out of scope if not)? [NFR, Gap]
- [X] CHK025 Are logging/traceability requirements for API calls specified (correlation IDs, metrics)? [NFR, Spec §FR-015]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [X] CHK026 Are external dependency behaviors (upstream dataset freshness, schema evolution) captured as assumptions/constraints on API semantics? [Dependency, Spec §Assumptions]
- [X] CHK027 Is versioning/migration policy for schema changes documented (deprecation timelines)? [Dependency, Gap]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [X] CHK028 Is the definition of "deterministic" unambiguous across spec and API (tie-breakers, ordering)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-009]
- [X] CHK029 Do any field names or meanings conflict between `UnifiedRecordResponse` and entity definitions? [Conflict; Contracts; Spec §Key Entities]
- [X] CHK030 Is there an ID scheme for requirements and acceptance criteria to support traceability references? [Traceability, Gap]
