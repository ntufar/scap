Here's a tailored project that directly maps to the Navigator 2.0 requirements:

## Supply Chain Analytics Platform - End-to-End Implementation

### Project Overview
Build a multi-source supply chain data platform using Databricks that demonstrates the key technical capabilities needed for Navigator 2.0. This simulates integrating supplier, logistics, and inventory data into a unified analytics layer.

### Architecture Components

**Data Sources (Simulated Enterprise Integration):**
- Supplier performance data (CSV/JSON - simulating ERP extracts)
- Shipment tracking data (streaming - simulating IoT/logistics APIs)
- Inventory levels (periodic updates - simulating warehouse systems)
- Cost data (static reference tables)

**Recommended Datasets:**
- **DataCo Supply Chain Dataset** (Kaggle) - comprehensive supply chain transactions
- **Supply Chain Shipment Pricing Dataset** (Kaggle) - logistics and cost data
- **Manufacturing Production Data** (UCI or synthetic generation)

### Technical Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Data Mesh Foundation (Week 1-2)**
- Set up Unity Catalog with multiple catalogs (bronze/silver/gold)
- Implement domain-oriented data ownership structure
- Configure row/column-level security and data access policies
- Create data lineage documentation
- **Databricks Skills:** Unity Catalog, governance, metastore setup

**Phase 2: Automated Ingestion Pipelines (Week 2-3)**
- Build Auto Loader pipelines for incremental CSV/JSON ingestion
- Create streaming pipeline for "real-time" shipment updates
- Implement schema evolution and data quality checks
- Set up CI/CD using Databricks Repos + Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions
- Schedule jobs with Databricks Workflows
- **Databricks Skills:** Auto Loader, Structured Streaming, Workflows, Delta Live Tables

**Phase 3: Curated Data Layers - Medallion Architecture (Week 3-4)**
- **Bronze Layer:** Raw data with audit columns (ingestion timestamp, source system)
- **Silver Layer:** Cleaned, deduplicated, validated data with SCD Type 2 for supplier changes
- **Gold Layer:** Business-ready aggregations (lead times by supplier, capacity utilization, sufficiency metrics)
- Implement data quality framework with expectations/assertions
- **Databricks Skills:** Delta Lake, SCD patterns, data quality, optimization (OPTIMIZE, Z-ORDER)

**Phase 4: Supply Chain Analytics Metrics (Week 4-5)**
- **Lead Time Analysis:** Calculate average lead times by supplier, route, product category
- **Capacity Planning:** Aggregate supplier capacity vs. demand forecasts
- **Sufficiency Checks:** Build logic to flag inventory shortfalls
- **Cost Overlays:** Join shipment data with cost tables for total cost analysis
- Create materialized views for performance
- **Databricks Skills:** Complex SQL, window functions, performance tuning

**Phase 5: Network Optimization & Graph Analytics (Week 5-6)**
- Model supply chain as a graph (suppliers → warehouses → distribution centers)
- Use GraphFrames or NetworkX to analyze:
  - Shortest paths between nodes
  - Critical bottlenecks
  - Network resilience (what-if scenarios)
- Create graph projections optimized for query performance
- **Databricks Skills:** GraphFrames, advanced analytics, performance testing

**Phase 6: ML/AI Foundation (Week 6-7)**
- Build demand forecasting model using historical data
- Predict lead time delays using supplier performance patterns
- Track experiments with MLflow
- Deploy model to Model Registry
- Create batch inference pipeline
- **Databricks Skills:** MLflow, AutoML, Feature Store, model deployment

**Phase 7: Production Readiness & Governance (Week 7-8)**
- Implement monitoring and alerting (data quality failures, pipeline delays)
- Set up cost monitoring and optimization
- Create runbooks for operational issues
- Build UAT test cases and validation framework
- Document data catalog with business glossary
- Configure backup/disaster recovery
- **Databricks Skills:** Monitoring, cost management, operational excellence

### Deliverables (Portfolio-Ready)

1. **Architecture Documentation:** Diagram showing data mesh structure, ingestion patterns, security layers
2. **Working Pipelines:** Automated end-to-end data flows with error handling
3. **Dashboard Suite:** 
   - Supply chain executive dashboard (KPIs)
   - Operational metrics (pipeline health, data quality scores)
   - Lead time trends and supplier performance
4. **Governance Framework:** Unity Catalog setup, access policies, lineage
5. **CI/CD Implementation:** Git-integrated notebooks, automated testing, deployment pipelines
6. **Performance Benchmarks:** Query performance tests, optimization results
7. **Runbook/Playbook:** Operational procedures for monitoring and incident response
